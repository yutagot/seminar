	abstract = {We examined chemical etching of the Ge surface assisted by single sheets of chemically modiﬁed graphene in O2-containing water. Three types of graphene sheets were used: graphene oxide ({GO}), hydrazine-reduced {GO} (hyd-{rGO}), and hydrothermally treated {GO} in an ammonia solution (amm-{rGO}). amm-{rGO} possessing pyridinic-N atoms produced the highest etching rates of the graphene used for all water temperatures tested. We propose that graphene sheets catalyze Ge oxidation underneath the sheets and that this phenomenon probably originates from the enhanced adsorption of O2 molecules in water at local defects, such as graphene edges and carbon atoms next to pyridinic-N, in the sheets. Because O2 adsorption is the initial step of either the oxygen reduction reaction or direct oxidation, it results in the formation of soluble {GeO}2 at the graphene/Ge interface, leaving etched hollows under the sheets. In addition, we combined graphene-assisted chemical etching with lithography by using photoresist to fabricate a trench pattern on Ge.},

	abstract = {Chemical etching of silicon assisted by various types of carbon materials is drawing much attention for the fabrication of silicon micro/ nanostructures. We developed a method of chemical etching of silicon that utilizes graphene oxide ({GO}) sheets to promote the etching reaction in a hydroﬂuoric acid−nitric acid ({HF}−{HNO}3) etchant. By using an optimized composition of the {HF}−{HNO}3 etchant, the etching rate under the {GO} sheets was 100 times faster than that of our {HF}−H2O2 system used in a previous report. Kinetic analyses showed that the activation energy of the etching reaction was almost the same at both the bare silicon and {GO}-covered areas. We propose that adsorption sites for the reactant in the {GO} sheets enhance the reaction frequency, leading to a deeper etching in the {GO} areas than the bare areas. Furthermore, {GO} sheets with more defects were found to have higher catalytic activities. This suggests that defects in the {GO} sheets function as adsorption sites for the reactant, thereby enhancing the etching rate under the sheets.},

            The shape and density of grain boundary defects in graphene strongly influence its electrical, mechanical, and chemical properties. However, it is difficult and elaborate to gain information about the large-area distribution of grain boundary defects in graphene. An approach is presented that allows fast visualization of the large-area distribution of grain boundary–based line defects in chemical vapor deposition graphene after transferring graphene from the original copper substrate to a silicon dioxide surface. The approach is based on exposing graphene to vapor hydrofluoric acid ({VHF}), causing partial etching of the silicon dioxide underneath the graphene as {VHF} diffuses through graphene defects. The defects can then be identified using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, or Raman spectroscopy. The methodology enables simple evaluation of the grain sizes in polycrystalline graphene and can therefore be a valuable procedure for optimizing graphene synthesis processes.},

	abstract = {Vacuum-ultraviolet light irradiation under a high vacuum is a facile method to reduce graphene oxide ({GO}) sheets and therefore to enhance their electrical conductivity. The aim of this study was to investigate the local electrical properties of a reduced graphene oxide ({rGO}) monolayer and bilayer by using conductive atomic force microscopy ({CAFM}). Both the lateral and vertical {CAFM} measurements showed a higher current signal on the {rGO} bilayer than on the {rGO} monolayer. The enlargement of the tip contact area significantly affected the vertical {CAFM} measurements and enhanced the current signal in the bilayer regions. However, when performing the lateral {CAFM} measurements, the enlarged tip contact area had no obvious influence on the current signal. The increase in the current signal can be ascribed to the intrinsic enhancement of the electrical conductivity on the {rGO} bilayer. These results suggested that the stacked {rGO} sheets formed the new conductive paths for the carrier transportation in the lateral direction. This process can be further applied in producing microconductive patterns in multilayered {GO}.},

First, the Ge surface along the outer edges of the {rGO} sheets was etched. Then, an etched hollow was formed beneath the entire {rGO} sheet. This is probably due to the chemical activity at not only the outer edges but also at the local edges of the small holes in {rGO} sheets. As etching of the Ge surface proceeded, the {rGO} sheet covering the etched bottom of a hollow was physically bent.

	abstract = {Metal-assisted chemical etching ({MacEtch}, {MACE}) has been heralded as a robust and cost-eﬀective semiconductor fabrication technique that combines many advantages of wet and dry etching, while simultaneously overcoming their accompanying limitations. However, widespread use of {MACE} has been hindered partly due to the use of metallic catalysts such as Au that potentially introduce deep-level trap defects into Si processing. Moreover, alternative noble metal catalysts (e.g., Ag) embed an optically reﬂective ﬁlm within the etched substrate, which can be detrimental to devices that rely on {MACE}-generated structures for improved light absorption. Here, a versatile process is detailed whereby carbon nanotube ({CNT}) composite ﬁlms are used as catalysts for site-selective etching of Si(100) wafers. The so-called carbon-nanotube-assisted chemical etching ({CNT}-{ACE}) method enables solution-based and room-temperature fabrication of vertical Si micropillar arrays. Vertical etch rates ({VERs}) of Si samples etched by using nominally undoped {CNTs} and potassium tetrabromoaurate ({KAuBr}4)-doped {CNTs} are compared. Enhancement of {VER} from ∼28 to ∼142 nm/min is observed for {KAuBr}4-doped {CNTs} compared to undoped ﬁlms, which is attributed to a shift in the catalytic ﬁlm’s aggregate reduction potential toward that of pure Au. Raman spectroscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy reveal that the catalytic {CNT} layer is not degraded during etching. A solar-weighted reﬂectance ({SWR}) of ∼2\% is measured for Si micropillar arrays with embedded {CNT} membranes. This represents over 94\% reduction in {SWR} compared to bare Si and 33\% reduction compared to Si micropillar arrays fabricated via conventional {MACE} with embedded Au catalysts. A physical model is provided for the {CNTACE} mechanisms, including additional mass transport pathways for dissolution products through the {CNT} ﬁlm. The {CNTACE} method enables complementary metal−oxide−semiconductor ({CMOS}) compatible fabrication of Si micro/ nanostructures for device applications including photovoltaic solar cells and photodetectors and is particularly beneﬁcial for applications wherein nonreﬂective embedded contacts are desired.},

In contrast, etching of highly defective graphene oxide and its reduced form resulted in rapid homogeneous fracturing of the sheets into smaller pieces. On the basis of these observations, a slow and more controllable etching route was designed to produce nanoporous reduced graphene oxide sheets by hydrothermal steaming at 200 °C. The degree of etching and the concomitant porosity can be conveniently tuned by etching time. In contrast to nonporous reduced graphene oxide annealed at the same temperature, the steamed nanoporous graphene oxide exhibited nearly 2 orders of magnitude increase in the sensitivity and improved recovery time when used as chemiresistor sensor platform for {NO}2 detection. The results underscore the eﬃcacy of the highly distributed nanoporous network in the low temperature steam etched {GO}.},

	abstract = {The complete restoration of a perfect carbon lattice has been a central issue in the research on graphene derived from graphite oxide since this preparation route was first proposed several years ago, but such a goal has so far remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the highly defective structure of reduced graphene oxide sheets assembled into free-standing, paper-like films can be fully repaired by means of high temperature annealing (graphitization). Characterization of the films by X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy indicated that the main stages in the transformation of the films were (i) complete removal of oxygen functional groups and generation of atomic vacancies (up to 1,500 °C), and (ii) vacancy annihilation and coalescence of adjacent overlapping sheets to yield continuous polycrystalline layers (1,800–2,700 °C) similar to those of highly oriented graphites. The prevailing type of defect in the polycrystalline layers were the grain boundaries separating neighboring domains, which were typically a few hundred nanometers in lateral size, exhibited long-range graphitic order and were virtually free of even atomic-sized defects. The electrical conductivity of the annealed films was as high as 577,000 S·m–1, which is by far the largest value reported to date for any material derived from graphene oxide, and strategies for further improvement without the need to resort to higher annealing temperatures are suggested. Overall, this work opens the prospect of truly achieving a complete restoration of the carbon lattice in graphene oxide materials.},

	abstract = {Chemical etching of silicon assisted by a number of catalysts is attracting increasing attention in the fabrication of silicon micro−nanostructures. In practical applications, metal-free catalysts, including carbon materials, have been focused on as alternative materials for the assisted etching of silicon. Although this anisotropic etching process is suitable for the fabrication of silicon micro− nanostructures due to its simplicity and cost effectiveness, a number of challenges remain, such as the formation of a porous layer and peeling of the catalyst by the gases produced during the etching process. We herein report vapor-phase etching assisted by graphene oxide and its mechanism in terms of reaction kinetics. By optimizing etching conditions, graphene oxide enhances the etching reaction in the vapor phase without the formation of a porous layer. We also demonstrated the formation of micrometer-sized pores in the desired areas by combining the microcontact printing of graphene oxide with silicon etching in the vapor phase.},

	abstract = {Exfoliation, i.e. individual separation of carbon sheets, is of great interest to produce single-layered graphene nanosheets. Chemical or thermal treatments are popular approaches to exfoliate graphite chunks. In general, these conventional methods are assisted with intercalation via covalent or non-covalent functionalization, expansion, and swelling, adsorption of organic molecules in gas phase, solid nanoparticle insertion or direct molecular exfoliation. However, direct covalent modification of graphene is challenging and the zero-band gap of graphene limits its use in field-effect transistors in nanoelectronics. Therefore, the use of a band-gap tunable p-type semiconducting reduced graphene oxide ({rGO}) is an alternative route. There are several approaches to tune its band gap, including tailoring the chemistry. Critical parameters include the control of oxygen amount determined by the degree and time of oxidation and reduction conditions (e. g. temperature), often leading to nonstoichiometry. This short review therefore highlights the production of {rGO} focusing primarily on the effect of thermal treatmenton the nature and the role of oxygen during thermal exfoliation of {GO}. The impact of oxygen functionalization on the modulation of the band gap is also reviewed for chemically and thermally reduced {GO}, as well as chemically treated {rGO} followed by a thermal exfoliation.},

This research for the very first time illustrates successful wafer scale integration of graphene-related materials by a pulsed laser deposition technique, and controlled conversion of p to n-type 2D {rGO} by pulsed laser annealing using a nanosecond {ArF} excimer laser. Reduced graphene oxide is grown onto c-sapphire by employing pulsed laser deposition in a laser {MBE} chamber and is intrinsically p-type in nature. Subsequent laser annealing converts p into n-type {rGO}. The {XRD}, {SEM}, and Raman spectroscopy indicate the presence of large-area {rGO} onto c-sapphire having Raman-active vibrational modes: D, G, and 2D. High-resolution {SEM} and {AFM} reveal the morphology due to interfacial instability and formation of n-type {rGO}. Temperature-dependent resistance data of {rGO} thin films follow the Efros-Shklovskii variable-range-hopping model in the low-temperature region and Arrhenius conduction in the high-temperature regime. The photoluminescence spectra also reveal less intense and broader blue fluorescence spectra, indicating the presence of miniature sized sp2 domains in the vicinity of π* electronic states, which favor the {VRH} transport phenomena. The {XPS} results reveal a reduction of the {rGO} network after laser annealing with the C/O ratio measuring as high as 23\% after laser-assisted reduction. The p to n-type conversion is due to the reduction of the {rGO} framework which also decreases the ratio of the intensity of the D peak to that of the G peak as it is evident from the Raman spectra. This wafer scale integration of {rGO} with c-sapphire and p to n-type conversion employing a laser annealing technique at room temperature and pressure will be useful for large-area electronic devices and will open a new frontier for further extensive research in graphene-based functionalized 2D materials.},

Single-layer graphene reacts faster and shows random etch pits in contrast to natural graphite where nucleation occurs at point defects. In addition, basal plane oxygen species strongly hole dope graphene, with a Fermi level shift of ∼0.5 {eV}.

            Isolated graphene, a nanometer‐thick two‐dimensional analog of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, has recently sparked great excitement in the scientific community given its excellent mechanical and electronic properties. Particularly attractive is the availability of bulk quantities of graphene as both colloidal dispersions and powders, which enables the facile fabrication of many carbon‐based materials. The fact that such large amounts of graphene are most easily produced via the reduction of graphene oxide—oxygenated graphene sheets covered with epoxy, hydroxyl, and carboxyl groups—offers tremendous opportunities for access to functionalized graphene‐based materials. Both graphene oxide and graphene can be processed into a wide variety of novel materials with distinctly different morphological features, where the carbonaceous nanosheets can serve as either the sole component, as in papers and thin films, or as fillers in polymer and/or inorganic nanocomposites. This Review summarizes techniques for preparing such advanced materials via stable graphene oxide, highly reduced graphene oxide, and graphene dispersions in aqueous and organic media. The excellent mechanical and electronic properties of the resulting materials are highlighted with a forward outlook on their applications.},

              Here, a facile two‐step reduction method is introduced to fabricate reduced graphene oxide ({RGO}) films with remarkable structural qualities. Many attempts are made to fabricate {RGO} with high structural qualities resembling pristine graphene. However, designing a reduction method to obtain high‐quality {RGO} more productively is highly desirable. To address this matter, in the present work, monolayer graphene oxide films are, at first, chemically reduced using a mixture of hydroiodic acid and trifluoroacetic acid vapor within a few minutes. Second, the films are reduced thermally at 800 °C for 30 min with ethanol, to repair the lattice vacancies. Through this method, the authors succeeded in obtaining {RGO} with high structural quality and electrical properties approaching pristine graphene. Raman spectroscopic results show that these {RGO} films have a very low

This article presents that {GO} sheets reduced by high-temperature alcohol vapors exhibit highly graphitic structures and excellent electrical conductivity. The sheet resistance of thin transparent ﬁlms is lowered to ϳ15 k⍀/▫ ({\textgreater}96\% transparency). Field-effect transistors produced from these reduced {GO} sheets exhibit high effective ﬁeld-effect hole mobility up to 210 cm2/V · s. Raman spectroscopic studies reveal that the conductivity enhancement in the low mobility regime is attributed to the removal of chemical functional groups and the formation of six-fold rings. In the high mobility regime, the growth of the graphitic domain size becomes dominant for enhancing its electrical conductivity.

Various methodologies have been developed for realizing this goal, among them interfacial layer engineering has shown great success, which can optimize the electrical contacts between active layers and electrodes and lead to enhanced charge transport and collection. Interfacial layers also show profound impacts on light absorption and optical distribution of solar irradiation in the active layer and film morphology of the subsequently deposited active layer due to the accompanied surface energy change. Interfacial layer engineering enables the use of high work function metal electrodes without sacrificing device performance, which in combination with the favored kinetic barriers against water and oxygen penetration leads to polymer solar cells with enhanced performance stability. This review provides an overview of the recent progress of different types of interfacial layer materials, including polymers, small molecules, graphene oxides, fullerene derivatives, and metal oxides. Device performance enhancement of the resulting solar cells will be elucidated and the function and operation mechanism of the interfacial layers will be discussed.},

Here, we report the results of a fundamental study on the remarkable conversion between n- and p-type reduced graphene oxide ({rGO}) with changes in the thermal annealing temperature. It was found that the charge carriers in {rGO} for temperatures of 300−450 °C and 800−1000 °C are electrons (n-type), whereas for temperatures of 450−800 °C, they are holes (p-type). This is because the individual oxygen functional groups present on {rGO} are determined by the annealing temperature. We found that the predominance of electron-withdrawing groups (i.e., carboxyl, carbonyl, and sp3-bonded hydroxyl, ether, and epoxide groups) resulted in p-type {rGO}, although that of electrondonating groups (sp2-bonded hydroxyl, ether and epoxide groups) lead to n-type {rGO}. In addition, as a proof of concept, a ﬂexible thermoelectric device consisting of {GO}-700 and {GO}-1000 as p-type and n-type components, respectively, was fabricated. This device, which contained eight pairs of the two components, exhibited an output voltage of 4.1 {mV} and an output power of 41 {nW} for ΔT = 80 K. These results demonstrate that the carrier characteristics of {rGO} can be altered signiﬁcantly by changing the functional groups present on it, thus allowing it to be used in various applications including ﬂexible thermoelectrics.},

We carry out classical molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations on a large set of realistic {rGO} structures to decompose the eﬀects of diﬀerent functional groups on the stability, work function, and photoluminescence.

            Halogenated graphene derivatives are interesting due to their outstanding physical and chemical properties. In this paper, we present various methods for the synthesis of chlorinated graphene derivatives from graphene oxide and thermally reduced graphene. We performed exfoliation of graphene oxide in a chlorine atmosphere, plasma assisted exfoliation of graphite oxide using microwave radiation and finally direct chlorination of thermally reduced graphene by liquid chlorine under deep {UV} irradiation. The influence of the chlorination method on the resulting chlorinated graphenes was investigated by characterization of the graphenes, which was carried out using various techniques, including {SEM}, {SEM}-{EDS}, high-resolution {XPS}, {FTIR}, {STA} and Raman spectroscopy. Electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry. Although the graphenes were structurally similar, they involved remarkably different chlorine concentrations. The most highly chlorinated graphene exhibits a chlorine concentration of 11.7 at\%. Chlorinated graphenes with such properties could be used for reversible chlorine storage or as a starting material for further chemical modifications.},

These sensors exhibited a 360\% increase in response when exposed to 100 ppm {NO}2 in air, compared with thermally reduced graphene oxide sensors we reported earlier. We then present a new method of signal processing/data interpretation that addresses (i) sensing devices with long recovery periods (such as required for sensing gases with these R-{GO} sensors) as well as (ii) device-to-device variations. A theoretical analysis is used to illuminate the importance of using the new signal processing method when the sensing device suﬀers from slow recovery and non-negligible contact resistance. We suggest that the work reported here (including the sensor signal processing method and the inherent simplicity of device fabrication) is a signiﬁcant step toward the real-world application of graphene-based chemical sensors.},

Various reduction approaches were employed to investigate the eﬀect of the oxygen content on the work function of {GO} derivatives as thin ﬁlms on an indium tin oxide substrate. Such ﬁlms were reduced by stepwise thermal annealing in ultrahigh vacuum up to 650 °C, by chemical reduction with hydrazine, or by a combination of chemical and thermal reduction processes. The eﬀect of the {GO} ﬁlm thickness and the ﬂake size on the {WF} was also investigated. {UV} photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to correlate the {WF} of {GO} derivatives with their oxygen content. The results showed that the {WF} is strongly dependent on the oxygen content, reaching a ∼1 {eV} diﬀerence between {GO} and highly reduced {GO}, under the speciﬁc reduction conditions. The ﬁlm thickness aﬀects the work function, since in thin ﬁlms interaction with the substrate is pronounced. Finally, the {WF} of reduced {GO} after combination of chemical and thermal reduction reaches its lowest value of 4.20 {eV}, due to the presence of heteroatoms which doped the surface.},

            Isolated graphene, a nanometer‐thick two‐dimensional analog of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, has recently sparked great excitement in the scientific community given its excellent mechanical and electronic properties. Particularly attractive is the availability of bulk quantities of graphene as both colloidal dispersions and powders, which enables the facile fabrication of many carbon‐based materials. The fact that such large amounts of graphene are most easily produced via the reduction of graphene oxide—oxygenated graphene sheets covered with epoxy, hydroxyl, and carboxyl groups—offers tremendous opportunities for access to functionalized graphene‐based materials. Both graphene oxide and graphene can be processed into a wide variety of novel materials with distinctly different morphological features, where the carbonaceous nanosheets can serve as either the sole component, as in papers and thin films, or as fillers in polymer and/or inorganic nanocomposites. This Review summarizes techniques for preparing such advanced materials via stable graphene oxide, highly reduced graphene oxide, and graphene dispersions in aqueous and organic media. The excellent mechanical and electronic properties of the resulting materials are highlighted with a forward outlook on their applications.},

            Investigating interfacial water ordering on solid surfaces with different hydrophobicities is fundamentally important. Here, we prepared hydrophilic mica substrates with some areas covered by mildly hydrophobic graphene layers and studied the resulting hydration layers using three-dimensional (3D) force measurements based on frequency-modulation atomic force microscopy. Hydration layers of 0.3–0.6 nm were detected on bare graphene regions; these layers were considerably larger than the spacing measured on mica (0.2–0.3 nm). On the graphene-covered regions, we also observed the formation of special ordered structures of adsorbates over time, on which, surprisingly, no prominent hydration layers were detected. Based on these findings, we present one possible scenario to describe the formation process of the ordered interfacial structures and the enhanced oscillation period in the force profiles. This work also demonstrates the capability and significance of 3D force measurements in probing hydration behaviors on a heterogeneous substrate with a lateral resolution smaller than several nanometers.},

In contrast to the macropore regime which is well understood, little is known about the morphology and formation mechanism of mesopores. In this report mesopore morphology and its dependence on formation parameters, such as {HF} concentration, current density, bias, and substrate doping density, is investigated in detail. In addition, a simulation of the breakdown conditions at the pore tip is performed which shows that mesopore formation is dominated by charge carrier tunneling, while avalanche breakdown is found to be responsible for the formation of large etchpits. © 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

	abstract = {A study was performed to determine the inﬂuence of nitrate concentration and acidity on the reaction rate and selectivity of the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction on platinum. There are two diﬀerent nitrate reduction mechanisms on platinum: a direct mechanism (0.4–0.1 V vs. {SHE}) and an indirect mechanism (0.9–0.5 V vs. {SHE}). In the direct mechanism the dependence of the reaction rate on the nitrate concentration changes with increasing nitrate concentration. Whereas at low concentrations ({\textless}0.1 M) the reaction order in nitrate is positive, at high concentrations ({\textgreater}0.1 M) the reaction order is negative. This suggests that at high concentrations the amount of free surface sites determines the reaction rate. These free surface sites are needed either for the adsorption of a second species necessary for the reaction (water or hydrogen) or for the dissociation of nitrate to nitrite. Both at low and high nitrate concentrations the direct reduction is mainly selective towards ammonia, although small amounts of N2O and N2 were observed using diﬀerential electrochemical mass spectrometry ({DEMS}) at potentials between 0.4 and 0.2 V at high concentrations of nitrate. This N2 and N2O formation seems to be related to the {NOads} coverage on the electrode. The indirect reduction mechanism is autocatalytic as is illustrated by its unusual stirring behavior. Large amounts of {NO} were observed using {DEMS}. This suggests that not nitrate but {NOþ} (¡ {HNO}2) is involved in the actual electron transfer. {NOþ} is reduced to {NO}, which then reacts with {HNO}3 to reproduce {NOþ}, resulting in an overall reaction of nitrate to nitrite. Both nitrite and a high acidity are needed for this mechanism to develop, but addition of nitrite is not necessary since nitrite is present in small amounts in {HNO}3 solutions of concentrations over 4 M. The autocatalytic reduction mechanism slows down and eventually terminates when {NO} starts to react to N2O, as was observed using {DEMS}.},

To explore the potential limits of silicon nanowire transistors, we have examined the influence of source-drain contact thermal annealing and surface passivation on key transistor properties. Thermal annealing and passivation of oxide defects using chemical modification were found to increase the average transconductance from 45 to 800 {nS} and average mobility from 30 to 560 cm2/V‚s with peak values of 2000 {nS} and 1350 cm2/V‚s, respectively. The comparison of these results and other key parameters with state-of-the-art planar silicon devices shows substantial advantages for silicon nanowires. The uses of nanowires as building blocks for future nanoelectronics are discussed.},

The obtained silicon wires width ranging between 233 nm to 340 nm which fabricated under a controlled environment. This experiment utilized the use of silicon-on-insulator wafer as a raw material and atomic force microscope nanolithography as a method to fabricate the device structure. The bare device was electrically characterized using semiconductor parameter analyzer and behaved as a resistor where there was a current flow from one contact point to another contact point. The functionality of the fabricated junctionless device was prolonged by tested the device under gaseous environment at room temperature. The device resistivity was increased upon exposure to both target gases compared with before gas exposure. The response time and recovery time of the device was observed to be less than 1 minute for both target gases. The fabricated junctionless sub-micron silicon device showed higher sensitivity to carbon dioxide gas which calculated to be 138 \%.},

              We report that graphene defects serve as active catalytic sites for the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction ({NRR}). A defective graphene (without foreign elements) electrode exhibits an onset potential of 0.95 V versus Ag/{AgCl} for the electrochemical {NRR} in 5

              methanol, the graphene electrode does not show any poisoning effects. The {NRR} on the graphene electrode shows autocatalytic behavior, including an induction period prior to the onset of the cathodic current. Moreover, the reduction reaction is accelerated by the addition of nitrite ions, and this indicates that nitrite is a key intermediate species in the autocatalytic mechanism. Density functional theory calculations reveal that a nitrosonium ion, which is an essential electrochemically active intermediate for the {NRR}, can strongly adsorb on the defect sites of a graphene sheet with electronic interaction, which indicates that the defect site can act as the active center for the {NRR}.},

	abstract = {The ability to print graphene sheets onto large scale, ﬂexible substrates holds promise for large scale, transparent electronics on ﬂexible substrates. Solution processable graphene sheets derived from graphite can form stable dispersions in solutions and are amenable to bulk scale processing and ink jet printing. However, the electrical conductivity and carrier mobilities of this material are usually reported to be orders of magnitude poorer than that of the mechanically cleaved counterpart due to its higher density of defects, which restricts its use in electronics. Here, we show that by optimizing several key factors in processing, we are able to fabricate high mobility graphene ﬁlms derived from large sized graphene oxide sheets, which paves the way for all-carbon post-{CMOS} electronics. All-carbon source-drain channel electronics fabricated from such ﬁlms exhibit signiﬁcantly improved transport characteristics, with carrier mobilities of 365 cm2/(V·s) for hole and 281 cm2/(V·s) for electron, measured in air at room temperature. In particular, intrinsic mobility as high as 5000 cm2/(V·s) can be obtained from such solution-processed graphene ﬁlms when ionic screening is applied to nullify the Coulombic scattering by charged impurities.},

            We report a one-step polymer-free approach to patterning graphene using a stencil mask and oxygen plasma reactive-ion etching, with a subsequent polymer-free direct transfer for flexible graphene devices. Our stencil mask is fabricated via a subtractive, laser cutting manufacturing technique, followed by lamination of stencil mask onto graphene grown on Cu foil for patterning. Subsequently, micro-sized graphene features of various shapes are patterned via reactive-ion etching. The integrity of our graphene after patterning is confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. We further demonstrate the rapid prototyping capability of a stretchable, crumpled graphene strain sensor and patterned graphene condensation channels for potential applications in sensing and heat transfer, respectively. We further demonstrate that the polymer-free approach for both patterning and transfer to flexible substrates allows the realization of cleaner graphene features as confirmed by water contact angle measurements. We believe that our new method promotes rapid, facile fabrication of cleaner graphene devices and can be extended to other two dimensional materials in the future.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Bottom-up synthesis of graphene nanoribbons ({GNRs}) may open new possibilities in future electronic devices owing to their tunable electronic structure, which depends strongly on their well-defined width and edge geometry. For instance, armchair-edged {GNRs} ({AGNRs}) exhibit width-dependent bandgaps. However, the bandgaps of {AGNRs} synthesized experimentally so far are relatively large, well above 1 {eV}. Such a large bandgap may deteriorate device performance due to large Schottky barriers and carrier effective masses. Here, we describe the bottom-up synthesis of {AGNRs} with smaller bandgaps, using dibromobenzene-based precursors. Two types of {AGNRs} with different widths, namely 17 and 13 carbon atoms, were synthesized on Au(111), and their atomic and electronic structures were investigated by scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy. We reveal that 17-{AGNRs} have the smallest bandgap, as well as the smallest electron/hole effective mass, among bottom-up {AGNRs} reported so far. The successful synthesis of 17-{AGNRs} is a significant step toward the development of {GNR}-based electronic devices.},

By applying an anodic potential to the needle electrode against a Pt counter electrode, a pore with a diameter slightly larger than the diameter of the needle electrode was formed in both p-type and n-type Si, of which current eﬃciency was higher for n-type Si.

Firstly, an overview of the graphene categories is presented, and then the application of graphene in harsh working conditions is summarized. Besides, the effect of graphene family materials on the behavior of boundary triboﬁlm is examined. Accordingly, the lubrication mechanisms of graphene are summarized, which mainly include adsorption protection of boundary triboﬁlm, graphene microstructural transformation, graphene internal slippage, and micro bearing rolling-sliding effect. Finally, the critical challenges and future prospects for the application of graphene as next generation lubrication materials are discussed.

We perform etching with metal oxides such as {RuO}2 and {IrO}2 by transposing materials used in electrocatalysis to nanofabrication. These oxides can be solutionprocessed as polymers exhibiting similar capabilities of metals for {MACE}. Nanopatterned oxides can be obtained by direct nanoimprint lithography or block-copolymer lithography from chemical solution on a large scale. High aspect ratio silicon nanostructures were obtained at the sub-20 nm scale exclusively by cost-eﬀective solution processing by halving the number of fabrication steps compared to {MACE}.

First, the basic process and mechanism of metal‐assisted chemical etching is introduced. Then, the various influences of the noble metal, the etchant, temperature, illumination, and intrinsic properties of the silicon substrate (e.g., orientation, doping type, doping level) are presented. The anisotropic and the isotropic etching behaviors of silicon under various conditions are presented. Template‐based metal‐assisted chemical etching methods are introduced, including templates based on nanosphere lithography, anodic aluminum oxide masks, interference lithography, and block‐copolymer masks. The metal‐assisted chemical etching of other semiconductors is also introduced. A brief introduction to the application of Si nanostructures obtained by metal‐assisted chemical etching is given, demonstrating the promising potential applications of metal‐assisted chemical etching. Finally, some open questions in the understanding of metal‐assisted chemical etching are compiled.},

            In this work, we investigate the transport processes governing the metal-assisted chemical etching ({MacEtch}) of silicon (Si). We show that in the oxidation of Si during the {MacEtch} process, the transport of the hole charges can be accomplished by the diffusion of metal ions. The oxidation of Si is subsequently governed by a redox reaction between the ions and Si. This represents a fundamentally different proposition in {MacEtch} whereby such transport is understood to occur through hole carrier conduction followed by hole injection into (or electron extraction from) Si. Consistent with the ion transport model introduced, we showed the possibility in the dynamic redistribution of the metal atoms that resulted in the formation of pores/cracks for catalyst thin films that are ≲30 nm thick. As such, the transport of the reagents and by-products are accomplished via these pores/cracks for the thin catalyst films. For thicker films, we show a saturation in the etch rate demonstrating a transport process that is dominated by diffusion via metal/Si boundaries. The new understanding in transport processes described in this work reconcile competing models in reagents/by-products transport, and also solution ions and thin film etching, which can form the foundation of future studies in the {MacEtch} process.},

	abstract = {Metal-assisted chemical etching is a relatively new top-down approach allowing a highly controlled and precise fabrication of Si and Si/Ge superlattice nanowires. It is a simple method with the ability to tailor diverse nanowire parameters like diameter, length, density, orientation, doping level, doping type, and morphology. In a typical metal-assisted chemical etching procedure, a Si substrate is covered by a lithographic noble metal ﬁlm and etched in a solution containing {HF} and an oxidant (typically H2O2). In general, the function of the metal is to catalyze the reduction of H2O2, which delivers electronic holes necessary for the oxidation and subsequent dissolution of the Si oxide by {HF}. However, the details of the etching process using contiguous metal thin ﬁlms, especially the mass transport of reactants and byproducts are still not well understood. In this study, the etching mechanism was systematically investigated. Several models of metal-assisted chemical etching using a contiguous metal ﬁlm as a catalyst were developed and tested by performing diﬀerent well-controlled etching experiments. The experiments helped to identify two processes fundamental for the formation of Si nanowires. First, a thin porous layer is formed beneath the metal ﬁlm during etching, which facilitates the transport of the electrolyte ({HF} and H2O2). Second, the porous layer is continuously etched away in an electropolishing process, which occurs in direct contact with the metal ﬁlm. Our results lead to an improved understanding of the fundamentals of the metal-assisted chemical etching on a microscopic scale. It potentially paves a way to integrate lithography with metal-assisted chemical etching for fabrication of Si nanowires with adjustable surface patterns.},

On the basis of the traditional metal-assisted chemical etching process, an electric bias was applied to the Si substrate in {EMaCE}. The 3D geometry of the etching proﬁle was eﬀectively controlled by the bias in a real-time manner. The reported method successfully fabricated an array of over 10 000 vertical holes with diameters of 28 μm on 1 cm2 silicon chips at a rate of up to 11 μm/min. The sidewall roughness was kept below 50 nm, and a high aspect ratio of over 10:1 was achieved. The 3D geometry could be attenuated by the variable applied bias in real time. Vertical deep etching was realized on (100)-, (111)-Si, and polycrystalline Si substrates. Complex features with lateral dimensions of 0.8−500 μm were also fabricated with submicron accuracy.},

The composite structure drastically changed: the ratio of mesoporous layer thickness to macropore depth increased to 1.1 from 0.16 by using the highly-doped Si instead of the moderately-doped Si. The open circuit potential of Si in the etching solution shifted to the positive direction by the Pt deposition. The potential shift of highly-doped Si was smaller than that of moderately-doped Si, which can be explained by the polarization characteristics. We calculated the band bending in Si by using a device simulator that reproduced the conditions of Pt-particle-assisted etching. The results indicated that, in the case of highly-doped Si, the consumption rate of positive holes at the Si surface away from the Pt particles increases due to the tunneling effect, which is consistent with the thick mesoporous layer formation.},

Consequently, silicon below metal is electrochemically etched much faster than a naked silicon surface without metal coverage. Metals such as Ag and Cu have been utilized to catalyze the electrochemical etching. Feature sizes as small as 30 nm can be achieved by metal-assisted electrochemical etching.

In the presence of Pt nanoparticles, cone-shaped macropores were produced, and the pore depth and diameter increased with increasing H2O2 content. Current density inﬂuenced the pore morphology. For a sample loaded with Pt or Ag, an increase in applied current density widened the pore diameter.

Formation of meso- and macroporous Si, etched craters and polished Si are observed as the {HF}/H2O2 ratio decreases. The dissolution mechanisms are discussed on the basis of a localized hole injection from the Ag nanoparticles into Si and in terms of the well known chemistry of Si dissolution in {HF}-based chemical and electrochemical systems. At high {HF}/H2O2 ratio, there is no formation of oxide at the surface. Hole injection and Si dissolution occur at the level of the Ag nanoparticle only, resulting in the formation of meso and macropores depending on the Ag nanoparticle size. At low {HF}/H2O2 ratio, the Si surface is oxidized, the injected holes are homogeneously distributed and thus polishing occurs. There is an intermediate range of composition in which injected holes diffuse away from the Ag nanoparticles and cone-shaped macropores, several tens of nm in diameter are formed.},

In those composition regions where the solution is very low in {HNO}3 and rich in {HF}, the rate-limiting process is the oxidation step. Consequently, electron concentration, surface orientation, crystal defects, and catalysis by lower oxides of nitrogen play an important role. In those compositions where {HF} is in limited supply, dissolution of the formed oxide is the rate-controlling step and diffusion of the complexing fluoride species is the important factor. Therefore, crystal orientation and conductivity type independence as well as hydrodynamic control are the consequences. In order to meaningfully select an etching composition to solve a specific processing problem, it is necessary to understand this composition-mechanism interaction. Corollary with the mechanism understanding, sample geometry effects have been followed as a function of solution composition. The {HF}-{HNO}3-H20 solution composition plane has been characterized into various regions where the two basic mechanisms interact and specific procesing utilization is shown. Similar results are shown for the system {HFHNO}3-{HC}2HsO2. In addition, a number of particular etching problems are posed, and solutions offered, that make use of these composition characterizations, and show how one can use their information to solve other practical processing problems.},

            Structuring Si, ranging from nanoscale to macroscale feature dimensions, is essential for many applications. Metal‐assisted chemical etching ({MaCE}) has been developed as a simple, low‐cost, and scalable method to produce structures across widely different dimensions. The process involves various parameters, such as catalyst, substrate doping type and level, crystallography, etchant formulation, and etch additives. Careful optimization of these parameters is the key to the successful fabrication of Si structures. In this review, recent additions to the {MaCE} process are presented after a brief introduction to the fundamental principles involved in {MaCE}. In particular, the bulk‐scale structuring of Si by {MaCE} is summarized and critically discussed with application examples. Various approaches for effective mass transport schemes are introduced and discussed. Further, the fine control of etch directionality and uniformity, and the suppression of unwanted side etching are also discussed. Known application examples of Si macrostructures fabricated by {MaCE}, though limited thus far, are presented. There are significant opportunities for the application of macroscale Si structures in different fields, such as microfluidics, micro‐total analysis systems, and microelectromechanical systems, etc. Thus more research is necessary on macroscale {MaCE} of Si and their applications.},

The technique of magnetically guided {MACE}, involving {MACE} with a tri-layer metal catalyst, was developed to improve etching speed as well as to adjust the etching direction using an external magnetic ﬁeld. However, the controllability of the etching direction diminishes with an increase in the etching dimension, owing to the corrosion of Fe due to the etching solution; this impedes the wider application of this approach for the fabrication of complex micro Si structures. In this study, we modiﬁed a tri-layer metal catalyst (Au/Fe/Au), wherein the Fe layer was encapsulated to improve direction controllability; this improved controllability was achieved by protecting Fe against the corrosion caused by the etching solution. We demonstrated curved Si microgroove arrays via magnetically guided {MACE} with Fe encapsulated in the tri-layer catalyst. Furthermore, the curvature in the curved Si microarrays could be modulated via an external magnetic ﬁeld, indicating that direction controllability could be maintained even for the magnetically guided {MACE} of bulk Si. The proposed fabrication method developed for producing curved Si microgroove arrays can be applied to electronic devices and micro-electromechanical systems.},

The same recipe that works perfectly to produce ordered array of nanostructures for single-crystalline Si (c-Si) fails completely when applied to polycrystalline Si (poly-Si) with the same doping type and level. Another long-standing challenge for {MacEtch} is the diﬃculty of uniformly etching across feature sizes larger than a few micrometers because of the nature of lateral etching. The issue of interface control between the catalyst and the semiconductor in both lateral and vertical directions over time and over distance needs to be systematically addressed. Here, we present a selfanchored catalyst ({SAC}) {MacEtch} method, where a nanoporous catalyst ﬁlm is used to produce nanowires through the pinholes, which in turn physically anchor the catalyst ﬁlm from detouring as it descends. The systematic vertical etch rate study as a function of porous catalyst diameter from 200 to 900 nm shows that the {SAC}-{MacEtch} not only conﬁnes the etching direction but also enhances the etch rate due to the increased liquid access path, signiﬁcantly delaying the onset of the mass-transport-limited critical diameter compared to nonporous catalyst c-Si counterpart. With this enhanced mass transport approach, vias on multistacks of poly-Si/{SiO}2 are also formed with excellent vertical registry through the polystack, even though they are separated by {SiO}2 which is readily removed by {HF} alone with no anisotropy. In addition, 320 μm square through-Si-via ({TSV}) arrays in 550 μm thick c-Si are realized. The ability of {SAC}-{MacEtch} to etch through poly/oxide/poly stack as well as more than half millimeter thick silicon with excellent site speciﬁcity for a wide range of feature sizes has signiﬁcant implications for 2.5D/3D photonic and electronic device applications.},

The activation energy of silicon dissolution in {HF}-H2O2 mixtures is determined to be ∼50 {kJ}/mol, which supports a surface reaction controlled mechanism. This interpretation is checked by oxidation experiments of Si surfaces with {HF}-free H2O2 solutions.

            The autonomous motion behavior of metal particles in Si, and the consequential anisotropic etching of silicon and production of Si nanostructures, in particular, Si nanowire arrays in oxidizing hydrofluoric acid solution, has been systematically investigated. It is found that the autonomous motion of metal particles (Ag and Au) in Si is highly uniform, yet directional and preferential along the [100] crystallographic orientation of Si, rather than always being normal to the silicon surface. An electrokinetic model has been formulated, which, for the first time, satisfactorily explains the microscopic dynamic origin of motility of metal particles in Si. According to this model, the power generated in the bipolar electrochemical reaction at a metal particle's surface can be directly converted into mechanical work to propel the tunneling motion of metal particles in Si. The mechanism of pore and wire formation and their dependence on the crystal orientation are discussed. These models not only provide fundamental interpretation of metal‐induced formation of pits, porous silicon, and silicon nanowires and nanopores, they also reveal that metal particles in the metal/Si system could work as a self‐propelled nanomotor. Significantly, it provides a facile approach to produce various Si nanostructures, especially ordered Si nanowire arrays from Si wafers of desired properties.},

	abstract = {The formation of the Schottky barrier height ({SBH}) is a complex problem because of the dependence of the {SBH} on the atomic structure of the metal-semiconductor ({MS}) interface. Existing models of the {SBH} are too simple to realistically treat the chemistry exhibited at {MS} interfaces. This article points out, through examination of available experimental and theoretical results, that a comprehensive, quantum-mechanics-based picture of {SBH} formation can already be constructed, although no simple equations can emerge, which are applicable for all {MS} interfaces. Important concepts and principles in physics and chemistry that govern the formation of the {SBH} are described in detail, from which the experimental and theoretical results for individual {MS} interfaces can be understood. Strategies used and results obtained from recent investigations to systematically modify the {SBH} are also examined from the perspective of the physical and chemical principles of the {MS} interface.},

The two most widely used and studied wet etchants of silicon are {FÀ} and {OHÀ}. Their mechanisms of atom removal share many things in common; in particular, chemical passivation by a hydrogen-terminated surface plays an important role in both. Crucially, however, their initiation steps are different, and this leads to important differences in the structures of the materials produced by the etchants. The initiation of etching by {FÀ} is electrochemical in nature, responding to the electronic structure of the Si, and is, therefore, a self-limiting reaction that can produce nanocrystalline porous silicon. Hydroxide etching destroys porous silicon because its initiation step is a catalytic chemical reaction and not a self-limiting process. A number of unanswered questions regarding the dynamics of ﬂuoride etching are highlighted.},

            Metal‐assisted chemical etching ({MacEtch}) of silicon in oxidizing hydrofluoric acid ({HF}) solutions has emerged as a prominent top‐down micro/nanofabrication approach for a wide variety of silicon micro/nanostructures. The popularity of the process is due to its simplicity, rapidity, versatility, and scalability. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in developing {MacEtch} silicon micro/nanostructures for advanced energy conversion and storage applications, such as photovoltaic devices, thermoelectric devices, lithium‐ion rechargeable batteries, and supercapacitors. Particularly, {MacEtch} has emerged as a powerful surface micro/nanostructuring method for low‐cost and scalable production of commercial black silicon (b‐Si) with excellent light trapping properties. This review on {MacEtch} processing of silicon in oxidizing {HF} solutions provides a critical description of its history and origin including how it evolved into what it is today, the understanding of its mechanism and important technical advances in the field. As regards {MacEtch}‐fabricated b‐Si, its initial discovery and further improvements to its large‐scale deployment in silicon photovoltaic industry are traced. Some fundamental challenges and perspectives in this exciting field are also discussed.},

	abstract = {This article presents a study on Metal-Assisted Chemical Etching ({MACE}) of silicon in {HF}-H2O2 using silver nanoparticles as catalysts. Our aim is a better understanding of the process to elaborate new 3D submicrometric surface structures useful for light management. We investigated {MACE} over the whole range of silicon doping, i.e., p++, p+, p, p−, n, n+, and n++. We discovered that, instead of the well-deﬁned and straight mesopores obtained in p and n-type silicon, in p++ and n++ silicon {MACE} leads to the formation of cone-shaped macropores ﬁlled with porous silicon. We account for the transition between these two pore-formation regimes (straight and cone-shaped pores) by modeling (at equilibrium and under polarization) the Ag/Si/electrolyte ({HF}) system. The model simulates the system as two nanodiodes in series. We show that delocalized {MACE} is explained by a large tunnel current contribution for the p-Si/Ag and n-Si/{HF} diodes under reverse polarization, which increases with the doping level and when the size of the nanocontacts (Ag, {HF}) decreases. By analogy with the results obtained on heavily doped silicon, we ﬁnally present a method to form size-controlled cone-shaped macropores in p silicon with silver nanoparticles. This shape, instead of the usual straight mesopores, is obtained by applying an external anodic polarization during {MACE}. Two methods are shown to be effective for the control of the macropore cone angle: one by adjusting the potential applied during {MACE}, the other by changing the H2O2 concentration. Under appropriate etching conditions, the obtained macropores exhibit optical properties (reﬂectivity ∼3 \%) similar to that of black silicon.},

These {GaN} nanowires are much more homogeneous than those synthesized in {AgNO}3/{HF} etchant. During the etching process, Cu and Ag particles appear primarily at the cracks in {GaN} films where the atoms are more reactive. After that, Cu accumulates continuously at the cracks, while Ag dendrites are formed and spread all over the whole {GaN} surface. These phenomena are ascribed to the different nucleation rates and diffusion rates of Ag and Cu. The metal particles thus formed block out ultraviolet illumination, and suppress the etching of {GaN}. It is the orderly accumulation of Cu particles that enables uniform photochemical etching. Our work proposes a novel metal-assisted photochemical etching method for synthesizing uniform {GaN} nanowires and reveals the physical distribution of the metal during etching.

            The autonomous motion behavior of metal particles in Si, and the consequential anisotropic etching of silicon and production of Si nanostructures, in particular, Si nanowire arrays in oxidizing hydrofluoric acid solution, has been systematically investigated. It is found that the autonomous motion of metal particles (Ag and Au) in Si is highly uniform, yet directional and preferential along the [100] crystallographic orientation of Si, rather than always being normal to the silicon surface. An electrokinetic model has been formulated, which, for the first time, satisfactorily explains the microscopic dynamic origin of motility of metal particles in Si. According to this model, the power generated in the bipolar electrochemical reaction at a metal particle's surface can be directly converted into mechanical work to propel the tunneling motion of metal particles in Si. The mechanism of pore and wire formation and their dependence on the crystal orientation are discussed. These models not only provide fundamental interpretation of metal‐induced formation of pits, porous silicon, and silicon nanowires and nanopores, they also reveal that metal particles in the metal/Si system could work as a self‐propelled nanomotor. Significantly, it provides a facile approach to produce various Si nanostructures, especially ordered Si nanowire arrays from Si wafers of desired properties.},

The stoichiometry of {MAE} in V2O5 + {HF} solutions depended on the chemical identity of the metal. The stoichiometry when etching with Ag and Au was the same as previously determined for electroless Si etching in V2O5 + {HF} solutions in the absence of a metal catalyst. With Pd and Pt nanoparticles the stoichiometry is signiﬁcantly different, consuming more V2O5 and producing less H2 per mole of Si etched. This indicates that the metal catalyst changes the mechanism of etching, implicating the polarization induced by the metal nanoparticle in the etch mechanism. Etching in V2O5 + {HF} was well behaved and gave consistently reproducible kinetic results. In contrast, we were unable to obtain well-behaved stoichiometries for {HOOH} + {HF} solutions.

Depending on the type of metal deposited and Si doping type and doping level, {PSi} with different morphologies and light-emitting properties is produced. {PSi} production occurs on the time scale of seconds, without electrical current, in the dark, on both p- and n-type Si. Thin metal coatings facilitate the etching in {HF} and H2O2, and of the metals investigated, Pt yields the fastest etch rates and produces {PSi} with the most intense luminescence. A reaction scheme involving local coupling of redox reactions with the metal is proposed to explain the metal-assisted etching process. The observation that some metal remains on the {PSi} surface after etching raises the possibility of fabricating in situ {PSi} contacts.},

	abstract = {Metal-assisted chemical etching ({MacEtch}) is an emerging anisotropic chemical etching technique that has been used to fabricate high aspect ratio semiconductor micro- and nanostructures. Despite its advantages in unparalleled anisotropy, simplicity, versatility, and damage-free nature, the adaptation of {MacEtch} for silicon (Si)-based electronic device fabrication process is hindered by the use of a gold (Au)-based metal catalyst, as Au is a detrimental deep-level impurity in Si. In this report, for the ﬁrst time, we demonstrate {CMOS}-compatible titanium nitride ({TiN})-based {MacEtch} of Si by establishing a true vapor-phase ({VP}) {MacEtch} approach in order to overcome {TiN}-{MacEtch}-speciﬁc challenges. Whereas {inverseMacEtch} is observed using conventional liquid phase {MacEtch} because of the limited mass transport from the strong adhesion between {TiN} and Si, the true {VP} etch leads to forward {MacEtch} and produces Si nanowire arrays by engraving the {TiN} mesh pattern in Si. The etch rate as a function of etch temperature, solution concentration, {TiN} dimension, and thickness is systematically characterized to uncover the underlying nature of {MacEtching} using this new catalyst. {VP} {MacEtch} represents a signiﬁcant step toward scalability of this disruptive technology because of the high controllability of gas phase reaction dynamics. {TiN}-{MacEtch} may also have direct implications in embedded {TiN}-based plasmonic semiconductor structures for photonic applications.},

Combination of cyclic voltammetry, open circuit measurements, chronoamperometry, impedance spectroscopy, and 2D band bending modeling of the metal/semiconductor/electrolyte interfaces at the nanoscale and under diﬀerent etching conditions allows gaining physical insights into this system. Additionally, in an attempt to mimic the etching conditions, the modeling has been performed with a positively biased nanoparticle buried in the Si substrate. Following these ﬁndings, the application of an external polarization during etching is introduced as a novel eﬃcient approach for achieving straightforward control of the pore morphology by acting upon the band bending at the Si/electrolyte junction. In this way, nanostructures ranging from straight mesopores to cone-shaped macropores are obtained as the Si sample is biased from negative to positive potentials. Remarkably, macroscopic cone-shaped pores in the 1−5 μm size range with a high aspect ratio (L/W ∼ 1.6) are obtained by this method. This morphology leads to a reduction of the surface reﬂectance below 5\% over the entire {VIS}-{NIR} domain, which outperforms macrostructures made by state of the art texturization techniques for Si solar cells.},

The anisotropic and the isotropic etching behaviors of silicon under various conditions are presented. Template‐based metal‐assisted chemical etching methods are introduced, including templates based on nanosphere lithography, anodic aluminum oxide masks, interference lithography, and block‐copolymer masks. The metal‐assisted chemical etching of other semiconductors is also introduced. A brief introduction to the application of Si nanostructures obtained by metal‐assisted chemical etching is given, demonstrating the promising potential applications of metal‐assisted chemical etching.

            In this work, we investigate the transport processes governing the metal-assisted chemical etching ({MacEtch}) of silicon (Si). We show that in the oxidation of Si during the {MacEtch} process, the transport of the hole charges can be accomplished by the diffusion of metal ions. The oxidation of Si is subsequently governed by a redox reaction between the ions and Si. This represents a fundamentally different proposition in {MacEtch} whereby such transport is understood to occur through hole carrier conduction followed by hole injection into (or electron extraction from) Si. Consistent with the ion transport model introduced, we showed the possibility in the dynamic redistribution of the metal atoms that resulted in the formation of pores/cracks for catalyst thin films that are ≲30 nm thick. As such, the transport of the reagents and by-products are accomplished via these pores/cracks for the thin catalyst films. For thicker films, we show a saturation in the etch rate demonstrating a transport process that is dominated by diffusion via metal/Si boundaries. The new understanding in transport processes described in this work reconcile competing models in reagents/by-products transport, and also solution ions and thin film etching, which can form the foundation of future studies in the {MacEtch} process.},

It is a simple method with the ability to tailor diverse nanowire parameters like diameter, length, density, orientation, doping level, doping type, and morphology. In a typical metal-assisted chemical etching procedure, a Si substrate is covered by a lithographic noble metal ﬁlm and etched in a solution containing {HF} and an oxidant (typically H2O2). In general, the function of the metal is to catalyze the reduction of H2O2, which delivers electronic holes necessary for the oxidation and subsequent dissolution of the Si oxide by {HF}. However, the details of the etching process using contiguous metal thin ﬁlms, especially the mass transport of reactants and byproducts are still not well understood. In this study, the etching mechanism was systematically investigated. Several models of metal-assisted chemical etching using a contiguous metal ﬁlm as a catalyst were developed and tested by performing diﬀerent well-controlled etching experiments. The experiments helped to identify two processes fundamental for the formation of Si nanowires. First, a thin porous layer is formed beneath the metal ﬁlm during etching, which facilitates the transport of the electrolyte ({HF} and H2O2). Second, the porous layer is continuously etched away in an electropolishing process, which occurs in direct contact with the metal ﬁlm. Our results lead to an improved understanding of the fundamentals of the metal-assisted chemical etching on a microscopic scale. It potentially paves a way to integrate lithography with metal-assisted chemical etching for fabrication of Si nanowires with adjustable surface patterns.},

On the basis of the traditional metal-assisted chemical etching process, an electric bias was applied to the Si substrate in {EMaCE}. The 3D geometry of the etching proﬁle was eﬀectively controlled by the bias in a real-time manner. The reported method successfully fabricated an array of over 10 000 vertical holes with diameters of 28 μm on 1 cm2 silicon chips at a rate of up to 11 μm/min. The sidewall roughness was kept below 50 nm, and a high aspect ratio of over 10:1 was achieved. The 3D geometry could be attenuated by the variable applied bias in real time. Vertical deep etching was realized on (100)-, (111)-Si, and polycrystalline Si substrates. Complex features with lateral dimensions of 0.8−500 μm were also fabricated with submicron accuracy.},

	abstract = {Electroless deposition of metal particles on silicon (Si) followed by the metal-assisted etching (metal-assisted chemical etching) is a simple way to fabricate Si nanostructures. A composite porous structure consisting of straight macropores and a mesoporous layer can be created by platinum (Pt)-particle-assisted etching. In this work, we studied the composite structure formation on a highly-doped p-Si (ca. 5 × 10
              18
              cm
              −3

              cm
              −3
              ). The composite structure drastically changed: the ratio of mesoporous layer thickness to macropore depth increased to 1.1 from 0.16 by using the highly-doped Si instead of the moderately-doped Si. The open circuit potential of Si in the etching solution shifted to the positive direction by the Pt deposition. The potential shift of highly-doped Si was smaller than that of moderately-doped Si, which can be explained by the polarization characteristics. We calculated the band bending in Si by using a device simulator that reproduced the conditions of Pt-particle-assisted etching. The results indicated that, in the case of highly-doped Si, the consumption rate of positive holes at the Si surface away from the Pt particles increases due to the tunneling effect, which is consistent with the thick mesoporous layer formation.},

By electrochemical measurement and sequent simulation, it is revealed that the potential of the valence band maximum at the silicon/metal interface is more negative than that of the silicon/electrolyte interface. Accordingly, holes injected from the back contact are driven preferentially to the silicon/metal interface. Consequently, silicon below metal is electrochemically etched much faster than a naked silicon surface without metal coverage. Metals such as Ag and Cu have been utilized to catalyze the electrochemical etching. Feature sizes as small as 30 nm can be achieved by metal-assisted electrochemical etching. Meanwhile, the metal-assisted electrochemical etching method enables convenient control over the etching direction of non-(100) substrates, and facilitates the fabrication of orientation-modulated silicon nanostructures.},

In {HF} solution without H2O2, a microporous layer was formed in p-Si loaded with Pt or Pd. However, Ag metal nanoparticles yielded pores due to their intrusion in the Si wafer. The addition of H2O2 to the etching solution leads to different pore morphologies depending on the metals. Particles of Ag were found at the bottom of most pores. In the presence of Pt nanoparticles, cone-shaped macropores were produced, and the pore depth and diameter increased with increasing H2O2 content. Current density inﬂuenced the pore morphology. For a sample loaded with Pt or Ag, an increase in applied current density widened the pore diameter. The mechanism of the metal-assisted pore formation was discussed by considering a competitive process between the formation of a microporous layer under polarization and metal-assisted chemical oxidation of the microporous layer by a dissolved oxidizing agent.},

Formation of meso- and macroporous Si, etched craters and polished Si are observed as the {HF}/H2O2 ratio decreases. The dissolution mechanisms are discussed on the basis of a localized hole injection from the Ag nanoparticles into Si and in terms of the well known chemistry of Si dissolution in {HF}-based chemical and electrochemical systems. At high {HF}/H2O2 ratio, there is no formation of oxide at the surface. Hole injection and Si dissolution occur at the level of the Ag nanoparticle only, resulting in the formation of meso and macropores depending on the Ag nanoparticle size. At low {HF}/H2O2 ratio, the Si surface is oxidized, the injected holes are homogeneously distributed and thus polishing occurs. There is an intermediate range of composition in which injected holes diffuse away from the Ag nanoparticles and cone-shaped macropores, several tens of nm in diameter are formed.},

	abstract = {The etching of silicon in {HNO}3-{HF} based systems proceeds by a sequential oxidation-followed-by-dissolution process. In those composition regions where the solution is very low in {HNO}3 and rich in {HF}, the rate-limiting process is the oxidation step. Consequently, electron concentration, surface orientation, crystal defects, and catalysis by lower oxides of nitrogen play an important role. In those compositions where {HF} is in limited supply, dissolution of the formed oxide is the rate-controlling step and diffusion of the complexing fluoride species is the important factor. Therefore, crystal orientation and conductivity type independence as well as hydrodynamic control are the consequences. In order to meaningfully select an etching composition to solve a specific processing problem, it is necessary to understand this composition-mechanism interaction. Corollary with the mechanism understanding, sample geometry effects have been followed as a function of solution composition. The {HF}-{HNO}3-H20 solution composition plane has been characterized into various regions where the two basic mechanisms interact and specific procesing utilization is shown. Similar results are shown for the system {HFHNO}3-{HC}2HsO2. In addition, a number of particular etching problems are posed, and solutions offered, that make use of these composition characterizations, and show how one can use their information to solve other practical processing problems.},

            Structuring Si, ranging from nanoscale to macroscale feature dimensions, is essential for many applications. Metal‐assisted chemical etching ({MaCE}) has been developed as a simple, low‐cost, and scalable method to produce structures across widely different dimensions. The process involves various parameters, such as catalyst, substrate doping type and level, crystallography, etchant formulation, and etch additives. Careful optimization of these parameters is the key to the successful fabrication of Si structures. In this review, recent additions to the {MaCE} process are presented after a brief introduction to the fundamental principles involved in {MaCE}. In particular, the bulk‐scale structuring of Si by {MaCE} is summarized and critically discussed with application examples. Various approaches for effective mass transport schemes are introduced and discussed. Further, the fine control of etch directionality and uniformity, and the suppression of unwanted side etching are also discussed. Known application examples of Si macrostructures fabricated by {MaCE}, though limited thus far, are presented. There are significant opportunities for the application of macroscale Si structures in different fields, such as microfluidics, micro‐total analysis systems, and microelectromechanical systems, etc. Thus more research is necessary on macroscale {MaCE} of Si and their applications.},

The technique of magnetically guided {MACE}, involving {MACE} with a tri-layer metal catalyst, was developed to improve etching speed as well as to adjust the etching direction using an external magnetic ﬁeld. However, the controllability of the etching direction diminishes with an increase in the etching dimension, owing to the corrosion of Fe due to the etching solution; this impedes the wider application of this approach for the fabrication of complex micro Si structures. In this study, we modiﬁed a tri-layer metal catalyst (Au/Fe/Au), wherein the Fe layer was encapsulated to improve direction controllability; this improved controllability was achieved by protecting Fe against the corrosion caused by the etching solution. We demonstrated curved Si microgroove arrays via magnetically guided {MACE} with Fe encapsulated in the tri-layer catalyst. Furthermore, the curvature in the curved Si microarrays could be modulated via an external magnetic ﬁeld, indicating that direction controllability could be maintained even for the magnetically guided {MACE} of bulk Si. The proposed fabrication method developed for producing curved Si microgroove arrays can be applied to electronic devices and micro-electromechanical systems.},

	abstract = {Defying text deﬁnitions of wet etching, metalassisted chemical etching ({MacEtch}), a solution-based, damagefree semiconductor etching method, is directional, where the metal catalyst ﬁlm sinks with the semiconductor etching front, producing 3D semiconductor structures that are complementary to the metal catalyst ﬁlm pattern. The same recipe that works perfectly to produce ordered array of nanostructures for single-crystalline Si (c-Si) fails completely when applied to polycrystalline Si (poly-Si) with the same doping type and level. Another long-standing challenge for {MacEtch} is the diﬃculty of uniformly etching across feature sizes larger than a few micrometers because of the nature of lateral etching. The issue of interface control between the catalyst and the semiconductor in both lateral and vertical directions over time and over distance needs to be systematically addressed. Here, we present a selfanchored catalyst ({SAC}) {MacEtch} method, where a nanoporous catalyst ﬁlm is used to produce nanowires through the pinholes, which in turn physically anchor the catalyst ﬁlm from detouring as it descends. The systematic vertical etch rate study as a function of porous catalyst diameter from 200 to 900 nm shows that the {SAC}-{MacEtch} not only conﬁnes the etching direction but also enhances the etch rate due to the increased liquid access path, signiﬁcantly delaying the onset of the mass-transport-limited critical diameter compared to nonporous catalyst c-Si counterpart. With this enhanced mass transport approach, vias on multistacks of poly-Si/{SiO}2 are also formed with excellent vertical registry through the polystack, even though they are separated by {SiO}2 which is readily removed by {HF} alone with no anisotropy. In addition, 320 μm square through-Si-via ({TSV}) arrays in 550 μm thick c-Si are realized. The ability of {SAC}-{MacEtch} to etch through poly/oxide/poly stack as well as more than half millimeter thick silicon with excellent site speciﬁcity for a wide range of feature sizes has signiﬁcant implications for 2.5D/3D photonic and electronic device applications.},

The generally very moderate reactivity is investigated regarding kinetic aspects and the silicon dissolution reactions. The activation energy of silicon dissolution in {HF}-H2O2 mixtures is determined to be ∼50 {kJ}/mol, which supports a surface reaction controlled mechanism. This interpretation is checked by oxidation experiments of Si surfaces with {HF}-free H2O2 solutions. Resulting silicon surfaces were characterized by means of diﬀuse reﬂection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy. Surface properties give hints for an “electrochemical” silicon oxidation. Furthermore, the oxidation behavior of diﬀerent H2O2 solutions is compared to that of {HNO}3 solutions. All results suggest kinetically limited silicon dissolution in {HF}-H2O2 mixtures and hole injection into the silicon surface to be the rate-determining part of the reaction process.},

            The autonomous motion behavior of metal particles in Si, and the consequential anisotropic etching of silicon and production of Si nanostructures, in particular, Si nanowire arrays in oxidizing hydrofluoric acid solution, has been systematically investigated. It is found that the autonomous motion of metal particles (Ag and Au) in Si is highly uniform, yet directional and preferential along the [100] crystallographic orientation of Si, rather than always being normal to the silicon surface. An electrokinetic model has been formulated, which, for the first time, satisfactorily explains the microscopic dynamic origin of motility of metal particles in Si. According to this model, the power generated in the bipolar electrochemical reaction at a metal particle's surface can be directly converted into mechanical work to propel the tunneling motion of metal particles in Si. The mechanism of pore and wire formation and their dependence on the crystal orientation are discussed. These models not only provide fundamental interpretation of metal‐induced formation of pits, porous silicon, and silicon nanowires and nanopores, they also reveal that metal particles in the metal/Si system could work as a self‐propelled nanomotor. Significantly, it provides a facile approach to produce various Si nanostructures, especially ordered Si nanowire arrays from Si wafers of desired properties.},

The two most widely used and studied wet etchants of silicon are {FÀ} and {OHÀ}. Their mechanisms of atom removal share many things in common; in particular, chemical passivation by a hydrogen-terminated surface plays an important role in both. Crucially, however, their initiation steps are different, and this leads to important differences in the structures of the materials produced by the etchants. The initiation of etching by {FÀ} is electrochemical in nature, responding to the electronic structure of the Si, and is, therefore, a self-limiting reaction that can produce nanocrystalline porous silicon. Hydroxide etching destroys porous silicon because its initiation step is a catalytic chemical reaction and not a self-limiting process. A number of unanswered questions regarding the dynamics of ﬂuoride etching are highlighted.},

Quantitative analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that nanopores were produced in areas of oxygenated groups (sp3 carbon bonds), creating porous reduced graphene oxide ({rGO}). The photoreaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of changes in the number of oxygenated groups. Proton conduction occurred at the basal plane of epoxide groups in virgin {GO}, even at low humidity, and at carboxyl groups for porous {rGO} at high humidity. Thus, {GO} and {rGO} samples with various morphologies, oxygenated functional groups, and conduction types can be easily fabricated by controlling the photoreaction conditions.},

	abstract = {This work introduces and explores vapor phase metal‐assisted chemical etching ({VP}‐{MaCE}) of silicon as a method to bypass some of the challenges found in traditional liquid phase metal‐assisted chemical etching ({LP}‐{MaCE}). Average etch rates for Ag, Au, and Pd/Au catalysts are established at 31, 70, and 96 nm/min respectively, and the relationship between etch rate and substrate temperature is examined experimentally. Just as with {LP}‐{MaCE}, 3D catalyst motion is maintained and three‐dimensional structures are fabricated with nanoparticle‐ and lithography‐patterned catalysts. {VP}‐{MaCE} produces less microporous silicon compared with {LP}‐{MaCE} and the diffusion/reduction distance of Ag
              +
              ions is significantly reduced. This process sacrifices etch rate for increased etch uniformity and lower stiction for applications in micro‐electromechanical systems ({MEMS}) processing.},

	abstract = {We have applied dispersion corrected density functional theory to gauge the reactivity of the most common defects found in graphene. Speciﬁcally, we investigated single vacancies, 585 double vacancies, 555−777 reconstructed double vacancies, Stone− Wales defects, and hydrogenated zigzag and armchair edges. We found that the extent to which defects increase reactivity is strongly dependent on the (a) functional group to be attached and (b) number of functional groups attached. For the addition of one H, F, and phenyl groups to defective graphene, we found the following decreasing order of reactivity: single vacancy {\textgreater} hydrogenated zigzag edge {\textgreater} 585 double vacancy {\textgreater} 555−777 reconstructed double vacancy {\textgreater} Stone−Wales {\textgreater} hydrogenated armchair edge {\textgreater} perfect graphene. However, when two phenyl groups are attached, the Stone−Wales defect becomes more reactive than the 585 double vacancy and 555−777 reconstructed double vacancy. The largest increase of reactivity is observed for the functional groups whose binding energy onto perfect graphene is small. In contrast with recent experimental results, we determined that the reactivity of edges in comparison with perfect graphene is much higher than the reported value. When two groups are attached onto a 585, 555−777, or Stones−Wales defect, they prefer to be paired on the same {CC} bond on opposite sides of the sheet. However, for the single vacancy, this is not the observed behavior as the preferred addition sites are those carbon atoms that were previously bonded to the missing carbon.},
